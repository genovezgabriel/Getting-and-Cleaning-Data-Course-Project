# *Getting and Cleaning Data course project*
The R script, run_analysis.R, was made according to the following steps:

1. Downloading and prepare all possible use libraries 
2. Creating data file in ".Rproj" and downloading the data
3. Merging "train" and "test" of each database (X, Y and subject)   
4. Creating a table only with means and standard deviations
5. Adding the columns "subject" and "activity"
6. Gathering subject, activity and all data to create one table
7. Average of each variable for activities and subjects

The end result is in the file "tidydata2.txt".
